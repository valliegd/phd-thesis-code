This folder contains the code utilised to run GangSTR and ExpansionHunter and extract information from their outputs. The source of both tools was acknowledged in the README in the top repository

gangSTR_code: Bash script for running GangSTR and extract information from resulting vcf

EH3_running_code_37 and _38: Bash script for running ExpansionHunter for genomes sequenced against genome build 37 and 38

retriving_fields: Bash script for retrieving genotyping information from the vcf files generated by ExpansionHunter

pileup_generating_code_37 and _38: Bash script for generating pileup plots for visual inspection for genomes sequenced against genome build 37 and 38

variant_catalog_HTT_37 and _38: variant catalog containing genetic sequences and genomic locations against genome build 37 and 38 of less stringent JSON file utilised for ExpansionHunter HTT locus prediction

variant_catalog_SCAs_37 and _38: variant catalog containing genetic sequences and genomic locations against genome build 37 and 38 of less stringent JSON file utilised for ExpansionHunter TBP, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, CACNA1A loci prediction
