This folder contains the R script written to compare the repeat expansion sizes predicted by both GangSTR and ExpansionHunter on WGS, and the generation of a complete dataset from the 100,000 Genome's Project of families described as trios (parents and proband), quads or quints (parents, siblings and proband)

Benchmark_PCR_vs_WGS: R script for extracting genotyping information from GangSTR and ExpansionHunter vcf output for comparison against PCR outputs

Complete_trio_analysis: R script to obtain a list of families categorised as trios from version 7 of the 100K GP of the individuals with complete recruitment, confirmed genetics vs reported checks and HTT allele size ExpansionHunter prediction

Complete_quad_analysis: R script to obtain a list of families categorised as quads from version 7 of the 100K GP of the individuals with complete recruitment, confirmed genetics vs reported checks and HTT allele size ExpansionHunter prediction
